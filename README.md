<b>Overview:</b>

Neighborhood Social is the online medium for a location-based bulletin board. This website and app will allow users to post various events based on their location to encourage a more integral community. This will focus on college campuses or neighborhoods where the population density is relatively dense.

The owners at Neighborhood Social have asked Scrumbledore’s Army to give their mobile app a “facelift”. Our team is currently in the process of developing the front end for the app. Our current project code is the skeleton/frame and once completed will be able to have the functioning app code injected into it and available for Android and iOS platforms.

<b>Release Notes</b>

Release 0.2: We used a template called Washington. The pages are all being updated with the correct menu items (Change To Do to Events, Terms and Conditions to be integrated into settings, and News Groups to Home; Remove Sign Up, Remove Password, Terms and Conditions, New To Do, About, Login, News List, Splash Screen)

We are making the app in HTML then use Phonegap to convert it to be Android/iPhone ready. We will be developing PHP to link to the online database after we finish the visual layout and pages.

<b>Release Notes</b>
	We used a template called Washington. The pages are all being updated with the correct menu items (Change To Do to Events, Terms and Conditions to be integrated into settings, and News Groups to Home; Remove Sign Up, Remove Password, Terms and Conditions, New To Do, About, Login, News List, Splash Screen)
	We are making the app in HTML then use Phonegap to convert it to be Android/iPhone ready. We will be developing PHP to link to the online database after we finish the visual layout and pages.
